# Pico-8 Games

[Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a virtual game console with a retro feel and some fun constraints like a 128x128px display and 16 colours. 

As they're tiny games, I'm putting all the source code in one repository with this README as an index. Each game has two files:

- the .p8 file is the game itself, readable as a text file as code 
- the .p8.png file which is the virtual 'game cartridge' that both shows a preview of the game and contains the data for the game in the .png file (how cool!) so you can load it into Pico-8 and play

## Games

### Penguino

First very basic Pico-8 game. Tiny penguin catches snowballs in a net and gains points. Don't ask me why. Use arrow keys to move left and right.
